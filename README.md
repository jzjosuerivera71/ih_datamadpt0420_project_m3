## Description:
The competition consists of who makes the best prediction to predict the different prices of a dataset of 40,000 diamond samples.

## I try three different algorithms which gave me these RMSE results: 

- Gradient Boosting Regressor : 528.06

- Random Forest Regressor : 535.29

- XGB Regressor : 539.22

## Dependencies:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- xgboost

## The algorithms can do a better performance with a different adjustment.
